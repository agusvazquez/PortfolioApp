  "headline": "I'm a Buenos Aires based React Native Developer. My personal goal is to improve the way of living of people by creating innovative mobile products.",
  "about_me": "I started mobile development back on 2011, when only a native approach (Java / Obj-C) was possible for building mobile apps. On 2018 I discovered React Native and continued working until today. During my career, I have also worked with databases, AWS, APIs and small websites (this site is hosted in AWS using a cloudfront and static website in S3). In my free time I like playing soccer/videogames with friends and also cooking."
