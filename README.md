# PortfolioApp

This is a sample app I developed to play around with Animations and build some sort of personal app to show off on interviews and recruiters.

It supports mobile web with react-native-web and the steps to launch it are the following:

- run `yarn`
- For web, run `yarn web`
- For app, run `yarn start`

If you open it on desktop it will show QR codes to install the app on expo application.
Otherwise if you are on a phone you will be able to use react-native-web based app.
