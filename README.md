# PortfolioApp [WIP]

This is a sample app I developed to play around with Animations and build some sort of personal app to show off on interviews and recruiters.

It supports web with react-native-web and the steps to launch it are the following:

- run `yarn`
- For web, run `yarn web`
- For app, run `yarn start`


In the future, expo files will be hosted on AWS and a QR code will be provided to scan it with your phone. I plan to host the website on https://sample.agustinvazquez.com
